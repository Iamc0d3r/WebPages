                    gathered
                    in a public meeting and they were fired upon by the British government without any warning, killing
                    hundreds. Bhagat Singh witnessed the whole event watching the deaths of many innocent people and who
                    were victims of discrimination.

                    February 1921. Singh became disillusioned with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence after he
                    called off the non-co-operation movement.

                    jail,
                    but returned to Lahore for unknown reasons.
                </li>

                    death of James A. Scott. Scott was the superintendent of police, he ordered the police to Baton
                    charge
                    the protesters. The plot of killing Scott went wrong and Singh killed J.P Saunders instead.
